Welcome to the Ableton Colorado User Patch Repository visit our site at http//abltn.com

This is greatly inspired by Mark Mosher's work with his Patchlab (http://patchlab.modulatethis.com/) I know that all of our users have spare patches or effects patches they can share.

So we created an area where we can share, store, and expand our library using the basic building blocks of Ableton (http://ableton.com).

The rules are simple:

    Original stuff please
    Nothing that requires wave files (contact me directly on this)
    No patches that require Ableton Suite (not all of us have that version - but we will consider expanding)
    Any patch config from the Ableton platfrom (Operator, Analog, Tension, M4L, etc) is welcome!
    Macro your patch and label the main 8 (or less) macro knobs. If you can't do it in 8 macros, turn it into multiple patches.
    When naming your knobs use logical names. One knob called "Tweak" is okay, but everything else should make sense (e.g. Filter Freq, wet/dry, distortion, etc)
    Yes! Max4Live patches are welcome!

How to submit: email your finished, labeled rack to marc@CreativeElectronica.com

Included in the email (please) :

    Your artist name
    Your Website or similar
    (Optional) How the patch should be filed and/or a new folder for the patch
        We are tying to keep things simple e.g. "Compression" includes mastering as well as other types of compression. So YOUR patch naming should reflect the minutia not our file system. 
    Any helpful information for users (there's a wiki)
    Anything else you want people to know about the patch

If you want to go a little deeper for any reason include the details and we will add it to the wiki!

If you would like to help and administer this repo - let me know.

Also - we have a ticket / issue area. Should you have questions, ideas, or other feedback, drop it in there.

Commercial / Professional Use - as a courtesy :

    Please contact me (marc@creativeelectronica.com) or the artist (site is prefixed on most patches) and notify on the use.
    This is critical as many of our users ARE PROFESSIONAL FREELANCE sound engineers (musicians, designers, etc). Your thank you helps keep us employed by adding a bump to the resume!
    There is no realistic method to enforce usage, so please respect the creators and let them know that they are doing good work and you appreciate the effort.

Finally - this stuff is all open source - I like the BSD license. If you prefer others, let me know and I will add a line to the wiki on your patch.
