Welcome to the Ableton Colorado User Patch Repository visit our site at http//abltn.com

This is inspired by Mark Mosher's work with his Patchlab (http://patchlab.modulatethis.com/) I know that all of our users have spare patches in Operator or an effects patch they can share.

So we created an area where we can share, store, and expand our library using the basic building blocks of Ableton (http://ableton.com).

The rules are simple:

    Original stuff please
    Nothing the requires wave files, we host the larger patches on our cloud (contact us for distribution)
    No patches that require Ableton Suite (not all of us have that version - but we will consider expanding)
    Use only the basic Ableton Live tools to create awesomeness!
    Macro your patch and label the main 8 (or less) macro knobs. If you can't do it in 8 macros, turn it into multiple patches!
    When naming your knobs use logical knobs. One knob called "Tweak" is okay, but everything else should make sense (e.g. Filter Freq, wet/dry, distortion, etc)
    Again please limit your work to a single macro rack. (you can nest but we ask you to keep it simple). The goal is to be able to drag it in and work it with a little learning as possible.
    Max4Live patches welcome too!

How to submit: email your finished, labeled rack to marc@CreativeElectronica.com

Included in the email (please) :

    Your artist name
    Your Website or similar
    Any helpful information for users (there's a wiki)
    Anything else you want people to know about the patch

If you want to go a little deeper for any reason include it and we will add it to the wiki here!

If you would like to help and administer this repo - let me know.

Also - we have a ticket / issue area. Should you have questions, ideas, or other feedback, drop it in there.

Finally - this stuff is all open source - I like the BSD license. If you prefer others, let me know and I will add a line to the wiki on your patch.
